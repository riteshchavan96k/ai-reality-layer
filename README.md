# ai-reality-layer
AI Reality Layer — infrastructure for giving autonomous AI systems continuously verified information about the world before they reason, decide, or act.

## Development validation

Install the production and test dependencies through the development requirements file, then run the complete backend regression suite from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
```

GitHub Actions runs the same backend test suite automatically on pushes and pull requests to `main`.

## MVP current-information retrieval

AI Reality Layer can use an opt-in provider-neutral HTTPS retrieval endpoint for current/external evidence.

Configure an endpoint template containing the literal `{query}` placeholder:

```bash
export ARL_HTTP_RETRIEVAL_ENDPOINT_TEMPLATE='https://retrieval.example.com/search?q={query}'
```

The endpoint must use HTTPS. A successful response should be a JSON object such as:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "content": "Company X launched Feature A today.",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Official Company X update",
      "uri": "https://example.com/company-x"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then call:

```http
POST /api/v1/reality-state
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": "What is the current status of Company X?"
}
```

The retrieval service supplies source content only. AI Reality Layer performs the deterministic claims, evidence-linking, provenance, observation, freshness, conflict, confidence-signal, and Reality State assembly stages.

If no retrieval endpoint is configured, requests that require external/current evidence fail closed through the existing unavailable/insufficient Reality State path rather than fabricating evidence.

## Already have search or RAG evidence?

Use the direct evidence endpoint instead of configuring AI Reality Layer retrieval:

```http
POST /api/v1/reality-state/evidence
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": "What is the current status of Company X?",
  "documents": [
    {
      "title": "Company X official update",
      "uri": "https://example.com/company-x-official",
      "content": "Company X launched Feature A today."
    },
    {
      "title": "Independent report",
      "uri": "https://example.com/company-x-report",
      "content": "not Company X continues to operate."
    }
  ]
}
```

The documents remain source-scoped during claim extraction, so claims retain the URI(s) they actually came from. Exact duplicate claims across sources are merged while preserving all source references.

This endpoint does not fetch the submitted URIs and does not run the configured retrieval provider. It processes the supplied evidence through evidence-quality validation, claim extraction, claim/evidence linking, provenance, observation, freshness, conflict detection, confidence signals, and Reality State assembly.

Freshness remains uncertain in this initial direct-evidence contract because ingestion time is not treated as source publication time.
